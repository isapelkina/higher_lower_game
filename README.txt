Higher-Lower Guess Game
1. Prompt for Max Number
The application prompts the user for a maximum number.
The application validates the user input and does not allow invalid entries (negative
numbers, 0 , or non-numbers), re-prompting the user if an invalid entry is provided.
If the user provides a decimal number, the application rounds it.
The application selects a random number between 1 and N (where N is the user-
provided maximum number).

2. Validate the Guess
The application prevents the user from guessing a non-number and displays an
appropriate error message.
The application prevents the user from guessing a number less than 1 and displays an
appropriate error message.
The application prevents the user from guessing a number greater than N and displays
an appropriate error message.

3. Track the Guesses
The application correctly initializes an array and uses the push() function to add the
guesses.
The application correctly formats the win message to include the comma-delimited
guesses as part of the output.
The application uses the length property and does not use an extra variable to count the
number of guesses.

4. Prevent Duplicate Guesses
The application correctly checks the array for a guess first using any means (loop,
find() , etc.) before adding a guess to the array.
The application correctly displays a message that a number has already been guessed.
